# CS-255-System-Analysis-and-Design

#Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The DriverPass project was for a client named Liam, who runs a small business that helps people get ready for their driver’s tests. He wanted a system that would let students sign up, take practice tests, schedule driving lessons, and keep track of their progress. The goal was to make learning easier and help students feel more confident before taking their test.

#What did you do particularly well?
I think I did well at writing clear business requirements and making sure they matched what the client wanted. I also made sure my system design covered the main features like scheduling, user accounts, and practice tests. I took time to think about how both students and instructors would use the system in a simple and helpful way.

#If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
If I could change one part, I would fix my system design diagrams. I would make them more detailed and show better how each part connects and shares information. This would make it easier for others to understand how the system works.

#How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I thought about how students and instructors would use the system every day. I focused on making it easy to schedule lessons, take tests, and track progress. It’s very important to think about the user’s needs because it helps make a design that is not just functional but also easy to use and fits what people actually need.

#How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
When I design software, I like to start by understanding the main goals and then break them down into smaller steps. I use diagrams to picture how things will work before building them. In the future, I plan to keep using this approach but also get more user feedback early on. That will help make sure the final design really meets the user’s needs.
